Hello, my name is K. Srimathi. I’m currently pursuing my third year of Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at KIT Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology in Coimbatore. With a CGPA of 8.05, I am committed to academic excellence while continuously developing my practical and technical skills.

I have a solid foundation in programming, with hands-on experience in Python, Java, C, and C++. My strengths lie in problem-solving, code debugging, and algorithmic thinking, which I enjoy applying in both academic projects and self-driven learning.

To further enhance my technical expertise, I have earned multiple certifications:

Python Foundation Certification, covering the core principles and problem-solving using Python.

Juniper Networks Certification, which introduced me to networking fundamentals and practical network configuration.

Red Hat Certification, where I gained experience in Linux system administration, command-line tools, and open-source technologies.


These certifications have given me valuable exposure to both software development and system-level tools, helping me build a more rounded understanding of the tech industry.

Beyond my technical skills, I take pride in being an effective listener and managing my time well. I also enjoy creative activities such as painting and exploring new places through travel, which help me stay imaginative and refreshed.

I’m eager to take on new challenges and contribute meaningfully to a team, while continuously learning and growing in a dynamic and innovative environment.
